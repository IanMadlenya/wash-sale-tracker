In this situation, there is a loss on one day, followed by a whole bunch of losses on a following day with different numbers of shares. One might think that we should choose the 4 shares as the replacement, and split it into 3 and 1 and wash against the 3. In order for that to be ok, in the next iteration we would need to use that replacement lot (which is a loss) and find a replacement for it. However, the algorithm selects the loss based solely on the sell/buy date ordering. So in order to maintain that ordering, we instead select the second lot (one of the ones with 5 shares) as the replacement, and continue to propagate after that.
